There are several tools that you can use to scan a Docker container for secrets. Some options include:

    Trufflehog: This tool searches through code repositories and looks for high entropy strings, which could potentially be secrets such as passwords or API keys.

    GitRob: This tool scans public repositories for potentially sensitive information and is specifically designed to find secrets that have been accidentally committed to a repository.

    Gitleaks: This tool scans commit history, branches, and tags in a Git repository for secrets and sensitive information.

    Dockle: This tool is specifically designed to scan Docker images and containers for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. It can also check for the presence of secrets in environment variables and files.

It's important to note that these tools are not foolproof and may not catch every secret that is present in a Docker container. It's always a good idea to manually review the code and configuration of a container as well.

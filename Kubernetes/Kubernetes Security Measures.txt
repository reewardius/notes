- Enable RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and configure it properly to limit the access of each user or service account to the minimum required resources and actions.
- Use IaCST utility, which ensures that you deploy safe containers like kubeaudit, kubesec or kube-beacon.
- Use network policies to restrict the traffic flow between pods and namespaces.
- Use container runtime security measures like seccomp and apparmor to restrict the system calls that containers can make.
- Use Kubernetes Secrets to store sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and other credentials.
- Use TLS for securing communication between components of the cluster, such as etcd, kubelet, and kube-apiserver.
- Use Kubernetes Admission Controllers to validate and mutate incoming requests, lile OPA Gateekeeper or Kyverno policies.
- Disable unused APIs to reduce the attack surface of the cluster.
- Limit the resource usage of each pod to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
- Regularly scan the container images for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy, Grype, Clair, or Anchore.
- Use Docker CIS Benchmark to validate security configurations.
- Use Kubernetes CIS Benchmark to validate security configurations.
- Use Linux CIS Benchmark to validate security configurations.
- Use Windows CIS Benchmark to validate security configurations.
- Use Dockerfile Best Practices to ensure secure image creation.
- Use Docker Logging to track container events and activity.
- Monitor the cluster's activity using auditing and logging tools like Falco, Auditd, or Fluentd.

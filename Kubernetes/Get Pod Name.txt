There are a couple of options you can try if you don't have access to kubectl get pods:

    You can try using the hostname command to get the name of the pod:

$ hostname
my-pod-name

    You can try using the cat command to view the contents of the /etc/hostname file, which should contain the name of the pod:

$ cat /etc/hostname
my-pod-name

    You can try using the cat command to view the contents of the /proc/self/cgroup file, which should contain a line like /kubepods/besteffort/pod123456-abcdef/ where the pod name is pod123456-abcdef.

$ cat /proc/self/cgroup
...
/kubepods/besteffort/pod123456-abcdef/
...

Keep in mind that these options may not work if the pod is running in a namespace that you don't have access to, or if the pod was created using a custom hostname.

Docker daemon monitoring:

This command can be used to monitor changes in the Docker environment. 
When a container is started or stopped, when an image is pulled or deleted, or when a network is created or removed.

> docker events
> docker events --filter 'event=container'
> docker events --since '10m ago' # last 10 minutes
> docker events --filter 'event=container' --filter 'event=network'
> docker events --filter 'event=container,event=image,event=network'

This command allows you to see the standard output and standard error streams of a container, as well as any logs written to files or other locations
> docker logs CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID
> docker logs --tail 50 CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID # last 50 logs
> docker logs -f CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID #real time logs

example:

> docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
> docker logs CONTAINER_ID

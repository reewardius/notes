A debug certificate is a type of certificate used to sign and distribute Android application packages (APKs) during development and testing. It is generated by the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and allows developers to test and debug their apps on an Android device without having to go through the process of signing the app with a release certificate. Debug certificates are not intended for use in production and should not be distributed with apps that are to be released to the public.

To check if an Android app is signed with a debug certificate, you can use the command line tool "jarsigner" which comes with the Java Development Kit (JDK).

Here are the steps:

    Open a command prompt or terminal window.

    Navigate to the location of the APK file you want to check.

    Use the jarsigner tool to check the signature of the APK by running the command: jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs <apk file name>

    Look for the "X.509" in the output, if it says "CN=Android Debug" or "CN=debug" in the certificate chain, it means the apk is signed with a debug certificate.

    You can also use APK Analyzer, a tool that comes with Android Studio, to check the certificate by opening your APK file in it and navigate to the "Signing Report" tab.

Note: You can also check the signature of the app in the installed app's information on the settings of your android device.

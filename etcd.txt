In Kubernetes, both ConfigMaps and Secrets can be stored in etcd, which is the distributed key-value store that Kubernetes uses to store its configuration data. However, Secrets are stored in etcd in an encrypted format, while ConfigMaps are stored in plain text.

This means that ConfigMaps can be easily viewed or edited by anyone with access to the etcd database, but Secrets are secure and can only be accessed by authorized parties. It is important to use Secrets for storing sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and other confidential data, and to use ConfigMaps for storing non-sensitive configuration data.

In Kubernetes, etcd listens on port 2379 by default. You can use the curl command to modify the data in etcd by sending HTTP requests to the etcd API.

Here is an example of how you might use curl to set a key-value pair in etcd:

# curl -L http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/mykey -XPUT -d value="myvalue"

# etcdctl --endpoints=http://<MASTER-IP>:2379 get / --prefix --keys-only
# etcdctl --endpoints=http://<MASTER-IP>:2379 get / --prefix --keys-only | grep "secrets" => /path/to/secrets
# etcdctl --endpoints=http://<MASTER-IP>:2379 get /path/to/secrets => secret


# etcdctl --endpoints=http://<MASTER-IP>:2379 get /<prefix> --prefix --keys-only
# etcdctl --endpoints=http://<MASTER-IP>:2379 get <KEY>
# etcdctl --endpoints=http://<MASTER-IP>:2379 get mykey

# etcdctl --endpoints=http://<MASTER-IP>:2379 snapshot save ~/etcdemo/etcd.db 
# strings etcd.db
# strings etcd.db | grep something or not

This command sets the key mykey to the value myvalue in etcd. You can use similar curl commands to perform other operations on the data in etcd, such as retrieving or deleting key-value pairs.

It's important to note that modifying the data in etcd can have serious consequences for your Kubernetes cluster, as it is used to store important configuration data. It is generally not recommended to modify the data in etcd directly, unless you are an advanced user and understand the risks involved.

By default, anyone with access to the etcd API can perform operations on the data stored in etcd, including setting, retrieving, and deleting key-value pairs. This means that you do not need any special authorization to use the curl command to modify the data in etcd as shown in the previous example.

However, it is generally not recommended to allow unauthorized access to etcd, as it stores important configuration data for your Kubernetes cluster. Modifying this data improperly can have serious consequences for the cluster.

To secure etcd, you can use various authentication and authorization measures, such as enabling transport layer security (TLS) and setting up role-based access control (RBAC) rules. This can help to ensure that only authorized users and processes can access etcd and perform operations on its data.

To scan a private GitHub repository using Trufflehog and Gitleaks, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository locally using the command git clone [repository URL]
2. Install Trufflehog by running pip install trufflehog
3. Run Trufflehog on the repository by using the command trufflehog --regex --entropy=False [path to repository]
4. Install Gitleaks by running go get -u github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks
5. Run Gitleaks on the repository by using the command gitleaks --repo-path [path to repository] --verbose

Note: you should have golang installed in your system to run gitleaks.

You can also use Github Actions to scan your repository, which can automate the process and run the scans on a schedule.

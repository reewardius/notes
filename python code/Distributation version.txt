To see what distribution of Linux you have installed, you can use the lsb_release command. This command is part of the Linux Standard Base (LSB) and is available on most Linux distributions.

To use the lsb_release command, open a terminal window and enter the following command:

lsb_release -a

This will display information about your Linux distribution, including the distribution name, version number, and codename.

Alternatively, you can use the cat command to view the contents of the /etc/os-release file, which contains information about your Linux distribution. To do this, enter the following command:

cat /etc/os-release

This will display the contents of the /etc/os-release file, which includes the distribution name and version number.

You can also use the uname command to view information about your Linux kernel. To do this, enter the following command:

uname -a

This will display information about your Linux kernel, including the kernel version and the architecture of your system.

/etc/kubernetes/pki is a directory that contains public key infrastructure (PKI) files used by a Kubernetes cluster. PKI is a set of protocols and standards that are used to secure communication over networks by using public and private keys.

The /etc/kubernetes/pki directory typically contains the following files:

    ca.crt: The certificate authority (CA) certificate that is used to sign the certificates of other components in the cluster.
    ca.key: The private key of the CA.
    front-proxy-ca.crt: The CA certificate that is used to sign the certificates of front-proxy components, such as kube-proxy.
    front-proxy-ca.key: The private key of the front-proxy CA.
    sa.key: The private key of the service account key pair.
    sa.pub: The public key of the service account key pair.
    etcd/: A directory containing PKI files used by the etcd cluster.

These files are used to secure communication between the various components of the Kubernetes cluster. For example, the CA certificate and private key are used to sign the certificates of other components, such as the API server and kubelets. The service account key pair is used to authenticate service accounts, which are used to grant permissions to resources in the cluster.

and what keys are signed by the JWT token with serviceaccount in the cluster?

In a Kubernetes cluster, a JSON Web Token (JWT) token with a serviceaccount is used to authenticate and authorize a service account. A service account is a special type of user account that is used to grant permissions to resources in the cluster.

A JWT token with a serviceaccount is signed using the private key of the serviceaccount key pair. The serviceaccount key pair consists of a public key and a private key, and the private key is used to sign the JWT token.

When a service account needs to access a resource in the cluster, it uses the JWT token to authenticate itself. The API server, which is the central component of the Kubernetes control plane, verifies the JWT token using the public key of the serviceaccount key pair. If the token is valid, the API server grants the service account the permissions specified in the token.

Where is this public and private key stored?

In a Kubernetes cluster, the public and private keys of the serviceaccount key pair are stored in the /etc/kubernetes/pki directory.

The public key is stored in a file named sa.pub, and the private key is stored in a file named sa.key. These files are typically created when the cluster is set up, and they are used to authenticate and authorize service accounts in the cluster.

The /etc/kubernetes/pki directory is usually only accessible to the Kubernetes control plane components and is not accessible to other users or processes. This ensures that the keys are kept secure and are only used for their intended purpose.

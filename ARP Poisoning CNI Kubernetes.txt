There are several Kubernetes CNIs (Container Network Interfaces) that are not prone to ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning, including:

    Calico: This CNI uses IP-in-IP encapsulation to create a virtual network between pods, which eliminates the need for ARP broadcasts and reduces the risk of ARP poisoning.

    Flannel: This CNI uses VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN) to create a virtual network between pods, which also eliminates the need for ARP broadcasts and reduces the risk of ARP poisoning.

    Weave Net: This CNI uses its own routing protocol, which eliminates the need for ARP broadcasts and reduces the risk of ARP poisoning.

    Cilium: This CNI uses BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and XDP (eXpress Data Path) to create a virtual network between pods, which eliminates the need for ARP broadcasts and reduces the risk of ARP poisoning.

It is important to note that while these CNIs can reduce the risk of ARP poisoning, they cannot completely eliminate it as it can be caused by other factors as well.

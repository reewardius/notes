There are several ways to protect a product from a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack:

    Use a DDoS protection service: Many companies offer DDoS protection services that can help to absorb and mitigate the effects of an attack.

    Use a content delivery network (CDN): CDNs can help to distribute traffic across multiple servers, making it more difficult for an attacker to target a single point of failure.

    Use a firewall: A firewall can help to filter out traffic from known malicious IP addresses and block suspicious traffic patterns.

    Implement rate limiting: Rate limiting can help to prevent an attacker from overwhelming a server by limiting the number of requests that can be made in a given period of time.

    Monitor your network: Regularly monitoring your network can help you to detect and respond to a DDoS attack quickly.

    Keep software and systems updated: Keep all software and systems updated to the latest version to close any vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

It's also important to have a incident response plan in place in case of an attack and be aware of the legal implications of DDoS attacks.

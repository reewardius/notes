Vulnerability assessment:

    Identify all systems and assets in the network
    Use automated tools and manual methods to scan for known vulnerabilities
    Analyze and prioritize the findings to determine which vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk
    Create a plan to remediate or mitigate the vulnerabilities

Web Penetration Testing:

    Gather information about the target website, including IP addresses and technologies used
    Attempt to identify vulnerabilities in the web application and underlying infrastructure
    Attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities found to gain unauthorized access
    Report the findings and provide recommendations for remediation

API Penetration Testing:

    Understand the API structure and expected behavior
    Identify the endpoints and methods exposed by the API
    Attempt to identify vulnerabilities in the API, such as injection attacks or authentication bypasses
    Attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities found to gain unauthorized access
    Report the findings and provide recommendations for remediation

Mobile Penetration Testing:

    Identify the mobile applications to be tested
    Reverse engineer the mobile application to understand its structure and behavior
    Attempt to identify vulnerabilities in the mobile application and underlying infrastructure
    Attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities found to gain unauthorized access
    Report the findings and provide recommendations for remediation

Cloud Vulnerability assessment:

    Identify all systems and assets running in the cloud environment
    Use automated tools and manual methods to scan for known vulnerabilities
    Analyze and prioritize the findings to determine which vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk
    Create a plan to remediate or mitigate the vulnerabilities

Docker Security assessment:

    Understand the structure and layout of the Docker environment
    Identify all containers running in the environment
    Use automated tools and manual methods to scan for known vulnerabilities
    Analyze and prioritize the findings to determine which vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk
    Create a plan to remediate or mitigate the vulnerabilities

Kubernetes Security assessment:

    Understand the structure and layout of the Kubernetes environment
    Identify all pods, services, and deployments running in the environment
    Use automated tools and manual methods to scan for known vulnerabilities
    Analyze and prioritize the findings to determine which vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk
    Create a plan to remediate or mitigate the vulnerabilities

It is worth noting that these are general steps and the actual process may vary depending on the organization's specific needs and requirements. Additionally, it is important to note that security assessment is an ongoing process and should be regularly repeated to ensure that new vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.

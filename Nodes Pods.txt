I have worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster, how do I get to them from the master node?

In order to access the worker nodes from the master node in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the kubectl command-line tool.

To access a specific worker node, you can use the kubectl exec command to execute a command on the node. For example, to access the bash shell on a worker node named node-1, you can use the following command:

kubectl exec -it node-1 bash

You can also use the kubectl describe node command to view information about a specific node, including its name, status, and the pods running on it. For example:

kubectl describe node node-1

Keep in mind that you need to have the proper permissions and authentication to access the worker nodes in your cluster.

Then how do you get to the pod?

To access a specific pod in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the kubectl exec command in a similar way as you would for accessing a worker node.

For example, to access the bash shell in a pod named my-pod, you can use the following command:

kubectl exec -it my-pod bash

You can also use the kubectl describe pod command to view information about a specific pod, including its name, namespace, and the container(s) running in it. For example:

kubectl describe pod my-pod

Keep in mind that you need to have the proper permissions and authentication to access the pods in your cluster.

If you want to access a specific container within a pod, you can use the -c flag to specify the container name. For example:

kubectl exec -it my-pod -c my-container bash

You can also use the kubectl logs command to view the logs for a specific pod or container. For example:

kubectl logs my-pod
kubectl logs my-pod -c my-container

In order to use your private key to authenticate with GitHub, you will need to add it to your local machine's ssh-agent.

Here are the steps to add your private key to ssh-agent:

    Check if you have an ssh-agent running by running the command eval "$(ssh-agent -s)". If it is not running, it will start the ssh-agent.

    Add your private key to the ssh-agent by running the command ssh-add <path-to-private-key>. For example, ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

    Verify that your private key has been added to the ssh-agent by running the command ssh-add -l. This will list all the keys currently managed by the ssh-agent.

    Make sure that your public key is added to your GitHub account settings, in the ssh keys section.
	

curl -H "Authorization: token <access_token>" https://api.github.com/orgs/<org_name>/repos
git ls-remote --heads git@github.com:<org_name>/<repo_name>.git
git ls-remote --refs git@github.com:<org_name>/*.git

Please keep in mind that this command will list only the repositories to which you have access to, based on your ssh key.

git ls-remote --refs git@github.com:<org_name>/*

This command will return all the repository in the organization, however, it will not return all the branches in the repository

git clone ssh://git@github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
git clone git@github.com:ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY.git
git clone ssh://git@github.com/ORGANIZATION/REPOSITORY.git

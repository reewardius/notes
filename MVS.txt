Minimal Viable Security (MVS) is a concept that refers to the minimum level of security that an organization needs to have in place 
to protect against the most common and significant cyber threats. This typically includes measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, 
and regular security updates, as well as policies and procedures for employees to follow to ensure the safe handling of sensitive information. 
MVS is designed to provide a basic level of security while still allowing organizations to operate effectively, with the 
understanding that additional security measures can be added as needed.

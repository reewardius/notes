To create a Calico GlobalNetworkSet that denies certain IP CIDR ranges, you can use the calicoctl command-line tool. Here is an example of how to do it:

    First, create a file that lists the IP CIDR ranges that you want to block. For example, if you want to block the following IP ranges:

1.2.3.4/32
5.6.7.8/32
9.10.11.12/32

You can create a file called blocked-ips.txt that contains these ranges, one per line.

    Next, use the calicoctl tool to create the GlobalNetworkSet:

#calicoctl create --filename=blocked-ips.txt globalnetworkset blocked-ips

This will create a Calico GlobalNetworkSet called "blocked-ips" that denies the specified IP ranges.

To block these IP ranges via NetworkPolicy, you can create a NetworkPolicy that denies traffic from these ranges. For example, the following NetworkPolicy will deny all traffic from the "blocked-ips" GlobalNetworkSet:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: block-c2-traffic
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
  - from:
    - globalNetworkSetSelector:
        globalNetworkSetName: blocked-ips
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress

This NetworkPolicy will apply to all pods in the cluster, and it will deny all incoming traffic from the IP ranges specified in the "blocked-ips" GlobalNetworkSet.
